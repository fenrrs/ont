## Description
Open in New Tab is a firefox add-on that adds target="\_blank" to 
anchor elements with a specified classname on a specified domain.

## How to use

## History
Development of this add-on started 16th of November 2019 after my friends and I
had been annoyed for months that our universities website opening links in the same tab 
when we needed to open multiple websites to effectivly work.
The original version was hard coded to only work on that specific domain and with a hard coded classname.
Upon submitting it to AMO (addons.mozilla.org), the kind reviewer explained that add-ons hosted on AMO needed to 
have a public use, and in it's current state would not be able to be published.
However they mentioned that if the add-on was modified to work with a user-defined list of
domains with wildcards and user-defined classnames, it would be a great fit for AMO.
I was honestly really impressed with how supportive they were, especially since my code
was literally just a for loop adding target="\_blank" to elements with the "outbound" classname.

Thank you, kind reviewer, for inspiring me to learn how to develop and then create this add-on.
